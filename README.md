# Welcome to Ruby Towns!

Ruby Towns is an implementation of the most excellent Tiny Towns board game. I very much encourage you to get out and try the real thing and, if you like it, it absolutely belongs in your game collection. 
This is a version of the game that runs in your terminal! We are working on making it an executable so you don't need to bother with installing depencies and languages. That being said, if you are a contributor, read on!

# How to start

Ruby Towns is developed mainly in Ruby 3. You will need to have an install of Ruby before you can really do anything here. 

## To work on the project
1. Install ruby and run `bundle install` to download the necessary gems.
2. You will need to create a branch to work off of. Pushes directly to main should not be allowed, and any changes made must be done via pull request.

## To Play the game
open up your terminal (currently mac or powershell) and type `ruby board.rb`. This will launch the game.
